--- === mjolnir.grille ===
---
--- A module for moving/resizing your windows along a virtual and horizontal grid(s),
--- using a fluent interface (see Usage below).
---
--- mjolnir.grille was based on mjolnir.sd.grid and mjolnir.bg.grid modules, but went through
--- significant modifications to suit my workflows. For example, it allows one to use multiple grids
--- at the same time and uses a fluent interface, so the intentions are more readable.
---
--- The grid is an partition of your screen; by default it is 3x3, i.e. 3 cells wide by 3 cells tall.
---
--- Grid cells are just a table with keys: x, y, w, h
---
--- For a grid of 2x2:
---
--- * a cell {x=0, y=0, w=1, h=1} will be in the upper-left corner
--- * a cell {x=1, y=0, w=1, h=1} will be in the upper-right corner
--- * and so on...
---
--- Usage:
---   local grid = require "mjolnir.grille"
---
---   -- default grid is 3x3
---   local grid33 = grid:new(3, 3)
---   local grid42 = grid:new(4, 2)
---
---   local cmdalt  = {"cmd", "alt"}
---   local scmdalt  = {"cmd", "alt", "shift"}
---   local ccmdalt = {"ctrl", "cmd", "alt"}
---
---    == the code below needs to be reworked ==
---    -- move windows as per grid segments
---    hotkey.bind(cmdalt, 'LEFT', grid33:focused():left():move())
---    hotkey.bind(cmdalt, 'RIGHT', grid33:focused():right():move())
---
---    -- resize windows to grid
---    hotkey.bind(scmdalt, 'LEFT', grid33:focused():thinner():resize())
---    hotkey.bind(scmdalt, 'RIGHT', grid33:focused():wider():resize())
---
---    -- on a 3x3 grid make a 2x3 window and place it on left
---    hotkey.bind(cmdalt, 'h', grid33:focused():wide(2):tallest():leftmost():place())
---
---    -- on a 3x3 grid make a 1x3 window and place it rightmost
---    hotkey.bind(cmdalt, 'j', grid33:focused():tallest():rightmost():place())
---
---  defaults are:
---    1 cell wide, 1 cell tall, top-left corner, focused window
---
---  One must start with grid:focused() or grid:window('title') and end with a command move(),
---  place(), resize(), or act() (they are all synonyms for the same action). This chain of
---  command will return a function that one can pass to hotkey.bind.
